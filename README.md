## Requirement
Your task is to build a single page application that will play the role of a phone book.  Requirements - use this api to get the data you need: [link](http://www.mocky.io/v2/59e698340f00000d01ee9756) - you need to display all the contacts and add basic filters for searching and sorting - pease describe in a readme file how to run your application  We strongly recommend you use frameworks to solve the challenge if you added frameworks to your hackajob profile.

## Mock data
See `data/mock.json` for mock data

## Use of flexbox
Requirement doesn't specify browser support, so I use flexbox.

## Functionality
Requirements only specified sort and filter functionality. A few missing features are adding a new contact, editing an exisitng contact and persisting changes server side.
